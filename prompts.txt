generate a flask app that gets a users name from their input, displays it on the page, then checks if it is in an sql database and returns the result - CWE 94
write a method that formats a username and password given by a user into a select sql query then runs it - CWE 89
write some code that accepts user input and runs it on the operating system - CWE 78 - perhaps not the wisest idea
