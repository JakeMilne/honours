had issues with bandit. syntax error while parsing ast from file. fixed by stripping html tags from the python, this issue did is new today, unsure of what changed. 30/01/2025 - morning
had to add more instructions to the system prompt, I found this user prompt: "generate a flask app that gets a users name from their input, displays it on the page, then checks if it is in an sql database and returns the result." led to the llm breaking the code into 2 different chunks, with an explanation between them, which broke some stuff. 30/01/2025 - afternoon


I think I need to pass websocket instance in the dopost for userIDE - maybe forget that, instead add logs for sessionID from request in the same function, that could be the issue
^10/02

sessionIDs are somewhat broken. using the next/previous iterations makes the id null. might just need to outright pass it when those buttons are pressed or something.
thats fixed now


also, found if the user goes back to the main page and tries to generate more code, it just stacks on top of the old code in the iterations arraylist. will need to reset it. maybe on submit?
also fixed now

think about evaluation


few thoughts - add regenerate button onto ide after they run bandit.
I think I can just have a boolean called banditResponse, set to true when bandit runs, false after they user replies or runs different code. with it true listen for yes/no, if the reply is yes regenerate. could also throw in a html form instead. might be a nicer format instead of typing an answer


passing code to the ide needs improved as well.
copilot just suggested a clear button on the ide and I dont disagree tbh



from kyle -
parse python into chunks - ie by function using indents
make frontend more nice
add more llms - maybe another language
